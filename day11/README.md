*CSV*
A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data.

In this example:
- Each line represents a row of data.
- Values on each line are separated by commas.
- The first row is often used as a header, indicating what each column represents.

*.env*
- An `.env` file, short for "environment file," is a simple text file used in software development to store environment variables. 
- These variables typically hold configuration settings that can change between different environments, like development, testing, and production. 
- The `.env` file is a convenient way to load custom settings necessary for an application's runtime environment without hardcoding them into the source code.

Example of an .env File

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=12345
API_KEY=abcdef12345
